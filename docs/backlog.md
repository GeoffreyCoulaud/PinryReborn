# Backlog

**Living document.** What is still open, banded by nature first and by priority second. What already shipped lives
in git history, the handoffs under `docs/handoffs/`, and the annotated `vX.Y.Z-*` tags, not here.

## How to use this file

- This file holds **open items only**. Do not keep a "shipped" log here: completed work is recorded by git
  history, the handoffs under `docs/handoffs/`, and the annotated `vX.Y.Z-*` tags.
- **Three bands, by nature.** *Open work* is what someone will do. *Known limits* points at the document that
  records each one and holds no copy of it. *Before beta* holds dated events no session can start early. A limit
  is not debt and is not counted as debt.
- **Open work is grouped by priority**, not by module. Each item states the context and what must be decided or
  done, with a pointer to the relevant spec or handoff when one exists. `P0` = product decisions that shape the
  data model and the UI. `P1` = client ergonomics needed for the web UI and the browser extension. `P2` =
  operational debt (not UI blockers).
- **A review finding has four exits and only one is this file**: fixed inside the lot, a backlog item, an
  accepted limit written where the decision lives, or refused with the reason in the handoff
  (`docs/adr/0010-review-finding-dispositions.md`). Wrap states which exit each finding took.
- When an item is picked up, note the branch or sub-project next to it; when it merges, **delete it from this
  file** (its record now lives in the handoff and the tag).

## Open work

### P1: Client ergonomics (needed for the web UI and browser extension)

- **Browser-extension CORS origin.** Deferred from the CORS sub-project (decision B1): the extension
  does not exist yet and has no stable ID, so no origin is wired for it. When it ships, add its
  `chrome-extension://<id>` / `moz-extension://<id>` origin to `api.cors.origins`. See
  `docs/handoffs/2026-07-21 - handoff - cors.md`.
- **User data import (portability).** Export shipped (see `docs/handoffs/2026-07-22 - handoff - user-data-export.md`
  and the `v*-user-data-export` tag); the remaining half is **import**: let a user re-create their pins, boards,
  tags and images on this instance (or another one) from an export archive. The archive format is the contract:
  `docs/specs/2026-07-22-user-data-export.md` §4 defines the layout (`manifest.json`, `pins.jsonl`, `boards.jsonl`,
  `tags.jsonl`, `user.json`, `images/`), `formatVersion` is `1`, and every file's `sha256` is in the manifest.
  Open questions to spec: id remapping vs id preservation, conflict handling with existing rows, image de-dup on
  re-upload, and how much of the archive to trust (signature / manifest verification).

### P2: Operational debt

- **Re-measure the review regime after three lots.** `docs/adr/0014-review-budget-upstream.md` moved
  the review budget upstream on figures taken from the session transcripts, and nothing in this
  repository reproduces them. After three lots have run under the new regime, re-measure the three
  quantities the decision moves: the share of spend that goes to reviews, the hours between
  consecutive implementers, and the findings per review by kind. The question the numbers answer is
  whether asynchronous block review is paying for its rework and whether the angles are earning
  their dispatch. Whether the repository should own a transcript-measuring tool rather than a
  throwaway script is part of the item, not a prerequisite.

## Known limits

Recorded where the decision lives. None is a copy: follow the pointer.

- **Soft-delete read isolation leaves residuals.**
  `docs/adr/0008-structural-soft-delete-read-isolation.md`, and
  `docs/specs/2026-07-29-single-representation-soft-delete.md` section 4.6.
- **A unique constraint's named outcome is not checked against what the code does.**
  `docs/adr/0009-unique-index-named-outcomes.md`, decision 1.
- **The evidence guard is fired on more tools than it inspects**, deliberately, and narrowing it
  would set a worse trap than the cost it saves.
  `docs/adr/0011-own-the-agent-instructions.md`, consequences.
- **The partial-index state guard has a declared reach**, and one part of it is a correctness gap
  rather than a documentation one: it pins the predicate, not the uniqueness columns that make
  `findOne()` return at most one row. `PartialUniqueIndexStates` and
  `api-persistence-sqlite/src/test/kotlin/.../migration/PartialUniqueIndexStatesTest.kt`.
- **Authentication attempt counters are per process, and holding one account's login closed is
  cheap.** `docs/adr/0013-in-memory-authentication-attempt-limiting.md`: decision 1 (counters reset
  on restart, correct only while the deployment is one instance), decision 3 (the measured cost of
  keeping a named account out, and the `forget_after` / last-step interaction behind it), decision 4
  (eviction is a bypass, and nothing purges outside a recorded failure).

## Before beta

Dated events. No session starts these early.

- **Flatten the migration history.** The migration history is append-only, and that already constrains
  fixes: `users`/`pins`/`boards`/`tags` keep `when_created` / `when_modified` column names that no
  longer match the domain's `createdAt` / `updatedAt`, kept only because rewriting an applied migration
  changes its checksum and breaks startup. At beta, collapse `1.0` to `1.n` into a single generated
  baseline and take that fix with it. Until then, when a fix is blocked only by an already-applied
  migration, prefer the clean design and record the debt here. New 2026-07-23.

## Features

- **Perceptual `ImageHash` (pHash)** for pin deduplication / merging. Flagship of the sequenced **user-segmented base
  ** (see the roadmap section below).
- **Advanced pin / tag / board management** : Features that make the data model genuinely user-segmented and pleasant to
  use. To be explored.
- **Import from 3rd party sites**
  Initial candidates :
    - Pinterest (board import),
    - Danbooru / Gelbooru / Other booru (favorites import),
    - Instagram (saved collection import),
    - Reddit / Twitter / Pixiv (saved posts import).

  On some of these sites, a post may contain multiple media. We're not changing our semantic 1 pin = 1 media rule.
  Can be either a one-time import, or to sync a local pinry board with a remote source periodically, as the user
  chooses.
- **Video support** : Completes the 3rd party use case, since those allow posting videos as well. Videos are a 1st class
  citizen, just like images. Their renditions are the video's thumbnail in case of a still rendition, or an animated
  image of the first few seconds of the video (eg. 3s)
- **RBAC and quota system** : Allow admins to toggle features and define quotas per-role, from the API
- **Audience mechanics (public / private).** Until this lands everything stays `@Authenticated` and owner-scoped (
  non-owner → 403); no anonymous browsing, no public gallery, no shareable links. It will interact with boards (public /
  shared boards) and with the profile items.
- **Two-factor / step-up authentication**: TOTP + Passkey/WebAuthn, with a possible short-lived "sudo" elevation token
  for sensitive actions.

Gated on audience mechanics :

- **Hard-copy of a public pin or board** from user B into user A's own collection: a real, independent copy, not a soft
  link.
- **Public profiles**: the deferred slice of profile management.
